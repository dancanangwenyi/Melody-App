# Melody-App
The objective of this project is to develop a Wireless Melody Player that provides the following functionality: 
    - A user can select a tune on a mobile app. 
    - The information relating to the selected tune is sent from the mobile 
      device to the transmitting Raspberry Pi (RPI) that encodes and transmits this tune to the 
      receiving Raspberry Pi (RPI) wirelessly using either visible light or infrared light. 
    - A receiving RPI receives the encoded tune, decodes the message and plays the tune via a speaker 
      in real-time, with minimum delay as possible.
